# GitHub-Practice-For-All

Our FCC forum post: (https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/git-and-github-practice-for-all-us-noobies/171808)

### How to contribute, TL;DR Version

1. Fork a copy of this project to your own repository in the upper-right corner of this page!

2. Keep your fork synched! You need to create a git clone in your local storage, the step by step guide is available [here](#how-to-pr)

3. Now open the files in your own text editor of choice. You will find the files in "The Website" folder.

4. Write your name anywhere in the file so it shows up in the webpage!

5. Now git push the changes made to your own repository (if you use git push origin master it will automaticly put it in your forked repository, no need to fear that your git push will affect the original repository-this one)

6. SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST ON GITHUB (How to steps written below)

7. THAT'S IT, YOU'RE DONE, YOU SUCCESSFULLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT AND HOPEFULLY LEARNED SOMETHING ALONG THE WAY

8. Extra credit if you stay around for a few git pull's and more pull requests.


A few guidance rules to follow:
- you mustn't delete/replace the names already in the file
- you can contribute more than once
- you can also style the whole document, remove or place new styles to your own desires BUT the names already approved must stay in the document and must show up on the webpage(no matter how big or small, hint hint)
- you can put your name anywhere in the body tag of the html file or even create a new page linked to the first one and put it there
- Me and darrenFj will use our discretion with merge conflicts and will notify all parties of the decision (this sounds so formal)
- your best weapon here is your creativity
- all pull requests will be approved as long as they meet the first criteria

# Contributing

Please note that we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

<b>If you don't know where to start, check the "Guides" file for more information.</b>

## Making contributions

If there is a particular issue you want to fix, communicate your intention via the comments on the specific issue. This will ensure that you are not working on something someone else is close to finishing, and also gives you the opportunity to discuss your approach and get any help or advice you may need before starting.

If the bug or feature you wish to work on is not yet in the existing issues, add it to the issues thread first and comment regarding your intention to work on it straight away.

Aside from that, stick to the fork-pull workflow outlined below.

## Getting started

+ Fork this repo before making any changes - you will be initially pushing commits to **your fork**, not this repo.  

+ Create issues on **this** repo, not your fork, if you encounter bugs, non-ideal behaviour/css, or wish to request features.

<b>Below, you will find the summary of git guides from the Guides file. </b>

## How to PR
(pull request)

+ On your forked verision of the repo on GitHub, click the green 'clone or download' button and copy the link.
  + The link will look something like this: `https://github.com/RomchyFCC/GitHub-Practice-For-All.git` (but with your username, not mine)
+ In the terminal write the following command to clone the repo. This will give you a local copy to work on:
  + `git clone <paste-the-link-of-your-repo.git-here>`
  + eg: `git clone https://github.com/RomchyFCC/GitHub-Practice-For-All.git`
+ In your terminal navigate to the folder that was just created.
  + The command for this is `cd`
  + eg: `cd GitHub-Practice-For-All`
+ If your version of the repo is ever out of sync with the original repo, i.e. there are new commits on the master branch of the original that you don't have, you need to sync your repo before adding your contributions. **See below, in the section called 'How to sync your local repo with the original repo' for details**
+ **Create a new branch to work on** (you'll do this for your real contributions, too).
  + At the terminal, in the correct folder, run `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
  + `<new-branch-name>` should be replaced with something sensible, like `feature-login-form` or `fix-login-bug`
  + All together, an example: `git checkout -b feature-login-form`
+ Make the changes to the appropriate files.
+ Push your change to your fork:
  + `git push origin <your-branch-name>`
+ Open a pull request. Follow the guide here: [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
  + @mention anyone you specifically want to review your PR
+ From there, a reviewer will go through the rest of the process with you.
  + You may be required to make changes to your code before it gets pulled in to the master branch - have patience and know that the difficult bits are done.

+ Now you can delete your local and remote branches:
  + switch to `master` branch:  
    `git checkout master`
  + list all branches:  
    `git branch`  
    you should see `* master` and the second branch you created previously
  + now delete that second branch:  
    `git branch -D <name-of-the-branch>`
  + delete second branch from your GitHub:  
    `git push origin --delete <name-of-the-branch>`

## How to sync your local repo with the original repo

+ This setup should be done only once for the repo.  
  [source](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)  
  + List the current configured remote repository for your fork:  
    `git remote -v`  
    You should see two links with `origin` in front of them.  
    The links will begin either with `https` or `git@`
  + Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork:  
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/RomchyFCC/GitHub-Practice-For-All.git`  
    or  
    `git remote add upstream git@github.com:RomchyFCC/GitHub-Practice-For-All.git`  
    depending on which protocol you saw in the first step.
  + Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork:  
    `git remote -v`  
    now you should see four links: two `origin` and two `upstream`  


+ This should be done to check for updates on the remote repo:  
  [source](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
  + Get data from original repo:  
    `git fetch upstream`  
  + Switch to the `master` branch of your local repo:  
    `git checkout master`
  + Merge changes from the original repo into your local `master` branch:  
    `git merge upstream/master`
  + Now push changes to your GitHub repo:  
    `git push`

Now your local repo and your GitHub repo is up to date with the original repo you forked from.

## Any questions?

Could this CONTRIBUTING file be improved? Was anything inaccurate or unclear? Please open up an issue and suggest appropriate fixes. Good documentation is just as crucial as good code - so documentation contributions are just as valued as fancy code contributions!
